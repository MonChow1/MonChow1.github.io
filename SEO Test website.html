        <p>Where should I begin? There are so many paradoxes and conflicts that the mind goes through, itn't it easier to just be more rudimentary. Evolution they say has done this to us, this enhanced power of thinking, just tell us how to use it? That's all I ask, how to be, what to believe in for a healthy self and community</p>
